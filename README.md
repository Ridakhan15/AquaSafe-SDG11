## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is an **AI-powered Water Quality Monitoring System** designed to enhance water safety in urban areas. It leverages **machine learning** to classify water quality in real-time and generate early risk alerts, supporting **proactive water management** and public health safety.

Rapid urbanization and industrialization have led to contamination of water sources. Traditional water monitoring methods are often **periodic and reactive**, delaying detection and increasing health risks. This project addresses that gap using **intelligent, data-driven approaches**.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Improve early detection of water contamination.  
- Support **proactive urban water management**.  
- Enhance **public health safety**.  
- Contribute to **sustainable urban development** aligned with **SDG 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities**.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Urban communities face challenges due to:  

- Pollution from industrial and domestic sources.  
- Aging and outdated water infrastructure.  
- Lack of continuous, real-time water monitoring systems.  

Consequently, delayed detection of water contamination leads to:  

- Health hazards for residents.  
- Economic losses due to waterborne diseases.  
- Environmental damage.

## 💡 Proposed AI Solution

This system uses **machine learning** to monitor and classify water quality. Key features include:  

- Analyzes parameters like **pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and conductivity**.  
- **Random Forest classifier** to determine water safety levels.  
- Generates **early alerts** for potential contamination.  

The solution is **scalable, efficient, and interpretable**, providing actionable insights for authorities.
